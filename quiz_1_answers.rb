# 2. Array is an ordered object, like a list. A Hash contains key value pairs.
#   ie: array = ['a', 'b', 'c']
#   ie: hash = {name: Jose, age: 25, location: miami}
# 3. arr is now set at [1, 2, 3, 3]
#    returns [1, 2, 3]
#    if you do arr.uniq!, it will now set arr to return [1, 2, 3]
# 4. the .map method gets each object and runs a block for each one.
#     the .select method selects certain objects dependant on the criteria stated
# 5. You would set each key value using strings.
# => ie: hash = { "a" => "1", "c" => "2" }
